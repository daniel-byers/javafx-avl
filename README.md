This is the code for my AVL Tree implementation in Java completed during my second year of study at university. I decided to use Java for this so I could try out the JavaFX framework specifically, but also to practice my coding in Java generally.

Since completing second year I have re-written the logic behind this AVL Tree in Ruby, in which I believe I am more proficient.
